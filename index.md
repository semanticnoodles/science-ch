Welcome to some of my early experiments with R.

## VR in the time of Social Distancing 🏺
A quick and easy pipeline used to perform a small data mining task with R; the aim was to obtain a raw dataset with all the papers mentioning VR or Virtual Reality for the last decade (2010-2020) recorded in the PubMed database, and comparing them with the ones produced in the context of COVID-19. The results were presented by me at the [ICAMT Online Conference on October 7-8 (2020)](https://icamt.mini.icom.museum/icamt-online-conference-2020-call-for-papers/), and published in the homonymic proceedings:
